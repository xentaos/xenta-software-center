Hi, if you want to get involved, here there is a list o TODO items:

Well, the Gtk3 port is complete, there isn't a lot to do, anyway you can:

* Try to port LSC to PackageKit, i mean get the version and the size with packagekit, compile the database with packagekit and so on

Good Work!

And rember, Lubuntu Software Center should be light, don't try to use:

* WebKit
* Cairo
* Any module wich isn't related to Gtk or Apt (except for pynotify and/or routines modules - os, subprocess, ...)
